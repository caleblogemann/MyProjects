Programming

Style
    Variable Naming
        always use camelCase
        only use short variable names for variables with small scope
        use n as a prefix for the number of objects not num e.g. nFiles, nObjects
        prefix i for iterator e.g. iFile
        boolean variables should be postive e.g. isSquare and not isNotSquare
        constants use all caps with underscore separation e.g. MAX_ITERATIONS

        For structures
            capitalize structure name
            don't repeat e.g. use Segment.length not Segment.segmentLength

    Function names
        use camelCase
        use either verb to describe what function does or name to describe describe single output
        reserve word get, set, compute, find, is, has, should, initialize

    General
        always camelCase
        use latex not LaTeX
    Objects
        refer to this object as obj
        no spaces around input or output variables
        for getters return value named value
