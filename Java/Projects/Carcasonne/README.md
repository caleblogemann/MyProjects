Self Assessment
===============

I believe that I have completed all aspects of this project except for the
extra credit cloisters.
I think that I did fairly well at implementing good Object Oriented
design. I considered creating a completely separate controller class
to implement the MVC design, but instead I ended up putting that
functionality inside of the View class. I also wished that my View
and Model were a little less tightly coupled. I think they were sufficiently
loosely coupled but I think slight improvements could have been made.

I believe that my choice of data structure was sufficient. It wasn't the most
elegant or sophistaced but it got the job done without a lot of overhead.
I also customized my data structure by creating my own Tile class.
I had considered adding pointers to the Tiles around a given Tile object
in order to emulate a graph, but that didn't seem necessary with specialized
methods to access those adjacent tiles in my Game class.

I am really proud of my algorithms. I think that they are pretty nice and
rather small. There aren't any special cases. My algorithms can handle
any type of road or city. I would appreciate any feedback, while I think my
methods work well, I went back and forth on doing things one way or the other.
A lot of the time I was unsure about what was convention in java.

Overall I felt like this project went well. I thought it was a little harder
than I expected. I figured that this project would come more easily, but it
definately had its challenges.
